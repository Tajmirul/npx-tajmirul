            '<h2>Motivation</h2>\r\n<p>As a fan of the popular animated series "Rick and Morty," I was always interested in exploring the world of the show and discovering more about its characters and episodes. When I learned about a contest that involved building a website using a provided API, I saw it as an opportunity to showcase my skills and bring my passion for "Rick and Morty" to life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>About the Project</h2>\r\n<p>For the contest, I was tasked with building a website using the "Rick and Morty" API, React, and Tailwind CSS. The API provided information about the characters, episodes, and locations from the show, and I used this data to create a dynamic and interactive website.</p>\r\n<p>I started by familiarizing myself with the API and its structure, and then began to design and develop the website using React as the front-end framework and Tailwind CSS for styling. React made it easy for me to build the website with a modular structure and create reusable components for different sections of the site. Tailwind CSS allowed me to quickly add custom styles and responsive design elements to make the site look polished and professional.</p>\r\n<p>The website features several sections, including a character directory, episode guide, and a location map. Users can search for specific characters and episodes, and also filter the results based on criteria such as species or air date. The location map provides a visual representation of the different planets and dimensions from the show, and users can click on a location to learn more about it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Building this website was a great opportunity for me to combine my skills in React and Tailwind CSS with my love for "Rick and Morty." I was able to showcase my ability to work with APIs and create dynamic, user-friendly websites. I am proud of the final product and believe it is a testament to my technical skills and passion for the show. Whether you\'re a fan of "Rick and Morty" or just interested in React and Tailwind CSS, I hope you enjoy using this website as much as I enjoyed building it</p>',

        description:
            '<p>Have you ever thought about having your own custom terminal portfolio with a set of commands that showcase your skills and accomplishments? I did, and I turned that idea into a reality. In this blog post, I\'ll walk you through my journey of building a terminal portfolio using Node.js, complete with auto-complete functionality, and then publishing it as an npm package.</p>\r\n<p>Open terminal and run the command:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><code>npx tajmirul</code></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h2>The Idea</h2>\r\n<p>The idea of a terminal portfolio struck me one day. I wanted a unique way to present my skills and experiences to others. A terminal portfolio seemed like a perfect choice, given my love for command-line interfaces. So, I set out to create one.</p>\r\n<h2>The Command List</h2>\r\n<p>The first step was to define the commands that my terminal portfolio would support. Here\'s a list of the available commands:</p>\r\n<p><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">welcome</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Welcome message</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">help </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- List available commands</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">exit</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Exit the terminal</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">clear &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- Clear the terminal</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">echo &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>- Print a string to the terminal &nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">history &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- See command history</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">whoami &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>- Print the current user</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">gui &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- Visit my website</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">about &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- Know more about me</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">education &nbsp; </span>- My education background</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">experience &nbsp;</span>- Experience i have gathered so far</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">skills &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>- My skills</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">projects &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>- View my projects</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">contact &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- Contact Information</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">email &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>- Send me an email</code><br /><code><span style="color: #2dc26b;">resume &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>- Want to see my resume?</code></p>\r\n<h2>Input Challenges</h2>\r\n<p>The journey started with handling user input. I tried different libraries like <code>prompt-sync</code> and <code>prompt-sync-plus</code>, but they had their limitations. <code>prompt-sync</code> struggled with left and right arrow key support, and the up/down arrow keys didn\'t work as expected.</p>\r\n<h2>Embracing <code>readline</code></h2>\r\n<p>I finally settled on using Node.js\'s built-in <code>readline </code>module along with <code>process.stdin</code>. This combination allowed me to capture user input effectively and handle command history, left/right editing, and more. However, one crucial piece was still missing: auto-completion.</p>\r\n<h2>Auto-Complete Functionality</h2>\r\n<p>With <code>readline </code>in place, I had to implement auto-complete functionality manually. This involved analyzing user input, comparing it with available commands, and suggesting completions. It was challenging, but it added a great user experience to my terminal portfolio.</p>\r\n<h2>Two Days of Hard Work</h2>\r\n<p>Building this terminal portfolio was no walk in the park. It took two days of hard work, debugging, and testing to get everything right. But the satisfaction of seeing it function as intended was worth every moment.</p>\r\n<h2>Publishing as an npm Package</h2>\r\n<p>Once I was satisfied with the output, I decided to share my terminal portfolio with the world. I followed the npm package publishing process, but there was a catch. When I ran npx tajmirul, it didn\'t work as expected. Instead, the index.js file opened in a text editor.</p>\r\n<h2>The Shebang Solution</h2>\r\n<p>After some research, I discovered the issue. To make an npm package executable with npx, I needed to add a shebang line at the top of my entry file (typically index.js). The shebang #!/usr/bin/env node tells the operating system to use the Node.js interpreter to run the script. This simple addition solved the problem.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>Building a terminal portfolio with custom commands and auto-complete functionality was a fun and educational journey. It taught me a lot about handling user input, creating a command-line interface, and publishing packages on npm. If you\'re interested in building your own terminal portfolio or command-line tool, I hope this story inspires you to take the plunge. Happy coding!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',
